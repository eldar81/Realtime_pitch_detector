# Real-time pitch detector
This project aimed to provide instant pitch detection. Project uses [CREPE](https://github.com/marl/crepe) detector which is based on a deep convolutional neural network.

Now prediction provides right into the console in Hz. Color sticker represents the voice (sound) activity and set up as >0,4 confidence rate.
My laptop on Intel Core i7-8550U process one chunk of data in 130 ms on average. Which is pretty good because human reaction speed lays down between 150 and 300 ms.

## Future improvements:
1. Connect matplotlib library and implement real-time plotting
2. Convert frequencies (Hz) into notes
3. Add stave or piano keyboard to visual feedback to provide more user-friendly interface
4. Add module which will compare user's singing and actual notes of the song providing instant feedback to singer
